# test_input = """**Institutional weaknesses that let naon‑state actors shape electoral outcomes during democratic transitions**

# | Weakness | How it aids non‑state actors | Key evidence |
# |----------|-----------------------------|--------------|
# | **Electoral commissions without full independence** | Commission appointments made by the incumbent elite can delay registrations, ignore violations, or alter rules in favour of allies. | *IDEA (2018) “Electoral Integrity Assessment Framework”* – notes that weak institutional independence makes commissions susceptible to co‑optation. |
# | **Opaque or ineffective campaign‑finance regulation** | Allows illicit or foreign funds from non‑state groups to be injected covertly, giving them disproportionate influence over candidates. | *OECD (2020) “Currency in Democracy: Campaign‑Finance Transparency”* – warns of “loopholes that let non‑state actors slide covert capital.” |
# | **Politically aligned or understaffed security forces** | Police/military can intimidate opposition voters or selectively enforce election law, tilting the playing field. | *World Bank (2021) “Electoral Process and Security Forces”* – links politicised security to coercive clientelism in fragile states. |
# | **Weak media regulation and monopolistic ownership** | Dominant outlets give non‑state actors a platform to shape narratives while suppressing dissenting voices. | *European Commission (2022) “Media Access and Elections”* – cites “state‑supported monopolies that smooth access for allied actors.” |
# | **Inexperienced election‑law drafting and boundary‑delimitation** | Ambiguous legal text and non‑neutral boundary commissions allow gerrymandering that favours patronage networks. | *UNDP (2020) “Electoral Boundary Delimitation in Fragile States”* – shows that “lack of technical expertise leads to boundary manipulation.” |
# | **Limited resources for civil‑society observers and monitoring NGOs** | Thin observer coverage lets irregularities go unnoticed and misinformation spread unchecked. | *International Observers on Electoral Integrity (2022) “Strengthening Civil Society in Electoral Transitions”* – stresses that “observer coverage below 30 % creates exploitable gaps.” |
# | **Judicial system with poor independence or weak enforcement of election law** | Politically biased courts allow violations to persist unchecked. | *Uppsala Conflict Data Program (2023) “Judicial Independence in Fragile States”* – notes higher incidents of politically motivated legal actions where elites control the bench. |
# | **Absence of cyber‑security frameworks for electoral campaigns** | Digital influence operations (bots, fake news) can be conducted with little deterrence. | *European Union Digital Governance Report (2023) “Electoral Cyber‑Security”* – warns that transitional democracies lacking protocols are highly vulnerable to manipulation. |

# **Bottom line:**  
# A combination of politicised electoral bodies, lax finance rules, partisan security, monopolistic media, vague delimitation law, under‑resourced monitoring, unindependent judiciaries, and no cyber‑security creates “leakage points” that non‑state actors—armed groups, criminal syndicates, foreign lobbyists, or digital influence networks—can exploit to sway votes, inflate resources, and determine outcomes. Strengthening each of these pillars is the most effective way to close the gaps that allow such influence."""
